# Terrapress

Infrstructure as code for provisioning WordPress sites,
hosted on DigitalOcean, with certificate self signing,
running behind CloudFlare.

All code persisted from your WordPress files are the contents
of the `wp-content` folder of your WordPress. The rest of
the library code is reused, as is.
